{"Title": "Maryland Offshore Ocean Resources - Bottom Classification  Great Gull Bank [Maryland] {2002}", "Description": "Bottom classification based on ArcGIS 10.2 maximum likelihood raster classification, converted from raster to polygon.Data collected using QTC (Quester Tangent Corporation) bottom classification technology which collects and analyzes acoustic returns, and provides a framework for classifying the seabed into different regions based on their acoustic characteristics. Data is then post processed using QTC IMPACT software. These data were collected and processed in 2004.Equipment:Knudsen 320BP Dual Frequency Echosounder ( 28kHz/200kHz)Quester Tangent QTC View Seabed Classification SystemQuester Tangent QTC Impact Post-ProcessingFunding to compile these datasets provided by BOEM under cooperative agreement number: M14AC00007.
