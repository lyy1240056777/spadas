{"Title": "Designated Places [Maryland--Baltimore County]", "Description": "Census designated places (CDPs) are closely settled, named, unincorporated communities that generally contain a mixture of residential, commercial, and retail areas similar to those found in incorporated places of similar sizes. The Census Bureau works with local participants to delineate boundaries for CDPs. By defining CDPs, the Census Bureau can tabulate and disseminate data for localities that otherwise would not be identified as places in the decennial census data products. Each CDP will contain an identifiable core encompassing the area that is associated strongly with the CDP name and contains the majority of the CDP's population, housing, commercial structures, and economic activity. A CDP must comprise a reasonably compact and continuous land area internally accessible to all points by road. (Except where parts of a CDP are separated by a narrow corridor of incorporated territory, or where the topography or geographic patterns of settlement are not compact, but are irregularly shaped.) A CDP may not be located partially or entirely within an incorporated place or another CDP. A CDP encompasses the surrounding closely settled territory associated with the place name. The Census Bureau does not intend for a CDP to be an apartment complex or residential subdivision in densely settled areas or simply a crossroads in rural areas. There are no minimum or maximum population thresholds for recognition as a CDP. This represents a substantial change from all prior CDP criteria.", "Creator": "Baltimore County Government", "Provider": "Baltimore County Open Data Portal", "Resource Class": "Datasets and Web services", "Resource Type": "Vector data", "Temporal Coverage": "Continually updated resource", "Date Issued": "2016-09-20", "Place": "Maryland--Baltimore County, Maryland", "Rights": "Warranty and Disclaimer\u00a0The user or recipient of this data understands and acknowledges this data may be inaccurate or contain errors or omissions and the user or recipient assumes full responsibility for any risks or damages resulting from, arising from or in connection with any use of or reliance upon data displayed herein. \u00a0Baltimore County, Maryland does not warrant the accuracy or reliability of the data displayed herein. \u00a0Baltimore County, Maryland disclaims all warranties with regard to data displayed herein, including but not limited to, all warranties, express or implied, of merchantability and fitness for any particular purpose. \u00a0\u00a0Baltimore County, Maryland additionally disclaims all obligation and liability for damages, including but not limited to, actual, special, indirect, and consequential damages, attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees, and court costs incurred as a result of, arising from or in connection with the use of or reliance upon the data displayed herein.\u00a0The user or recipient hereby waives the right to file suit or make demand and forever discharges and releases Baltimore County, Maryland, its agents, employees, successors and assigns from any and all loss, liability, damage, claim, cost or expense incurred as a result of, or arising out of or in connection with the use of data displayed herein or any reliance thereon, whether caused by the acts or omissions of Baltimore County, Maryland, its agents, employees, successors or assigns, directly or indirectly. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The user or recipient of data, hereby acknowledges that Baltimore County, Maryland, its agents, employees, successors, and assigns shall not be responsible for any and all property damage or bodily injury (including serious physical injury or even death) incurred as a result of, or arising out of or in connection with the use of or reliance upon data displayed herein.\u00a0\u00a0The user or recipient hereby agrees to indemnify, protect and hold harmless Baltimore County, Maryland, its officers, agents, employees, successors and assigns from and against any and all suits, demands, losses, liability, damages, claims, costs or expenses incurred by Baltimore County as a result of, or arising out of or in connection with, the user or recipient\u2019s misuse\u00a0or misrepresentation of this data.\u00a0The user or recipient of the data displayed herein acknowledges and agrees to attach the following disclaimer when and if the user or recipient disseminates or cites this data:\u00a0This data is only for general information purposes only.
