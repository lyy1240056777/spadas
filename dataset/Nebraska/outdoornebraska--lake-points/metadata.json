{"Title": "Lake Points [Nebraska]", "Description": "The lake mapping program was developed as a cooperative initiative between the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) to provide detailed survey information on Nebraska's lakes and reservoirs. Each year a list of proposed lakes and reservoirs is submitted by biologists across the state and reviewed by a committee to determine the lakes of highest priority. A number of factors are taken into consideration including Aquatic Habitat Projects, lake conditions, fish communities, and angler use. The overall goal of the program is to provide fisheries managers with detailed information to be used in management and monitoring of Nebraska's lakes. Detailed bathymetric lake maps are also produced and made available to the public on the NGPC web site.", "Creator": "Nebraska Game & Parks Commission", "Provider": "Nebraska Game & Parks Map and Data Portal", "Resource Class": "Datasets and Web services", "Resource Type": "Vector data", "Temporal Coverage": "Continually updated resource", "Date Issued": "2021-09-22", "Place": "Nebraska", "Rights": "There are no restrictions on the use and distribution of data provided in this map or service.
