{"Title": "Metro Transit Ridership by Route [Wisconsin--Madison]", "Description": "Metro Transit ridership by route. Caution should be used with this data. Daily bus stop boardings were estimated using a 12-day sample of weekday farebox records and AVL logs, and the GTFS file, from March 2015 from Metro Transit. Ridership estimates exclude supplemental schoolday routes and paratransit service. Caution should be exercised when attempting to compare data from individual stops; ridership data should be considered in the context of the system as a whole. Bus stops were assigned to each boarding event given the estimated location of the bus at the time of the farebox transaction.
