The driver ran the stop sign on Kimball Street at Avenue S and crashed into an oncoming vehicle. The driver that ran the stop sign drove through my fence and almost into the side of my house. There are almost accidents at this intersection daily. If there was a speed bump, 4 way stop, or light, this accident most certainly would’ve been avoided. Please help us fix this ongoing problem.","BC accept planning proposal of Not Feasible, requestor reply sent - closed",,"2023-07-03T12:55:37.000","DOT-603623-R8S9",,"2023-07-10T00:00:00.000",,,,,,,,"2023-07-10T12:25:00.000","No","2023-07-02T00:00:00.000",,"41084","KIMBALL STREET","AVENUE S","AVENUE T","Brooklyn","3474000060","40.611614","-73.928460","40.609980","-73.926639","354035314530314580","318","No","Not Feasible","Does not qualify; Radar speeds BELOW criteria of 30.0 mph at 85%",,"A","One-way",,,,
