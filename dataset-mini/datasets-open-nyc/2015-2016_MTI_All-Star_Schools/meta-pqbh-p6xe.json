MTI activities blend academics and physical activity into educational lessons that support New York State PE Learning Standards and are integrated with Common Core Learning Standards.\r\n\r\nThe MTI program is free and includes benefits and incentives for students, teachers, principals, and schools.\r\nMTI activities are inclusive and designed to enhance academic learning during classroom instruction.\r\nA growing body of research suggests that student success depends on a combination of academic skills, healthy lifestyle, and physical and mental fitness. Specifically, in NYC, the correlation between fitness levels and academic achievement has been shown:\r\nhttp://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/survey/survey-2009fitnessgram.pdf\r\n\r\nMTI All-Star school\r\n\r\nSchools with a comprehensive PE program, led by a certified or designated PE teacher, have the opportunity to become an MTI All-Star school by training at least 85% of their eligible teachers in MTI.\r\n\r\nNew York State requires all elementary schools to provide at least 120 minutes of PE every week for all students. MTI All-Star schools can use MTI activities during classroom instructional time to supplement their existing PE program to meet this requirement.\r\n\r\nMTI All-Star schools receive MTI implementation guidance and Citywide recognition of MTI best practices\r\n\r\nAll NYC district public schools with classroom teachers serving grades K-5 are eligible to participate in the MTI program.\r\n\r\nFor the 2016-2017 school year, elementary schools can participate in MTI in two ways:\r\n\r\n1) MTI Train-the-Trainer\r\n\r\n- Certified or designated PE teachers from district public elementary schools can attend an MTI Train-the-Trainer (TTT) session where they will learn to become MTI trainers for their school.\r\n\r\n- TTT sessions are offered during school hours so PE teachers will need to be released to attend.\r\n\r\n2) MTI Event\r\n\r\n- K-5 classroom teachers (including cluster, PE, and special education) from district public schools can register for an open MTI workshop session offered citywide.\r\n\r\n- Participating teachers receive UFT negotiated training rate (for after-school hours) and a certificate of completion (can count towards the 175 hours of professional development contingent on principal\u2019s approval).\"", "displayType": "table", "domainCName": "data.cityofnewyork.us", "downloadCount": 862, "hideFromCatalog": false, "hideFromDataJson": false, "indexUpdatedAt": 1536602933, "newBackend": true, "numberOfComments": 0, "oid": 26257511, "provenance": "official", "publicationAppendEnabled": false, "publicationDate": 1498515727, "publicationGroup": 14289568, "publicationStage": "published", "rowClass": "", "rowsUpdatedAt": 1498515726, "rowsUpdatedBy": "7pdm-vrjs", "tableId": 14289568, "totalTimesRated": 0, "viewCount": 272, "viewLastModified": 1536606381, "viewType": "tabular", "approvals": [{"reviewedAt": 1512399623, "reviewedAutomatically": true, "state": "approved", "submissionId": 1067724, "submissionObject": "public_audience_request", "submissionOutcome": "change_audience", "submittedAt": 1512399623, "targetAudience": "public", "workflowId": 2285, "submissionDetails": {"permissionType": "READ"}, "submissionOutcomeApplication": {"failureCount": 0, "status": "success"}, "submitter": {"id": "ftn3-awiu", "displayName": "Vaughan Coleman"}}], "clientContext": {"clientContextVariables": [], "inheritedVariables": {}}, "columns": [{"id": 308247578, "name": "DBN", "fieldName": "dbn", "position": 1, "description": "A character code used to identify a school and its location.
