Eventually we will be expanding fleet share within and across agencies to account for a larger number of light duty non emergency units. DCAS also provides fleet share vehicles to NYCHA as part of an interagency MOU. Due in part to the use of shared vehicles the city was able to meet the requirements of EO 53 of 2019 and cut the citys fleet by over 1,000 vehicles. This resulted in an expense budget savings regarding fuel and maintenance and a capital savings in regard to replacement purchases. The shared program also provides us with the ability to have vehicles where they are needed and when they are needed rather than have some vehicles being used daily and some being used rarely.

The 2022 State Aid funding for Local Assistance is being adjusted to accommodate the 5.4% COLA.</p><p>The initial amounts for these initiatives will be paid directly to eligible providers with the annualized amounts included in the 2022-23 State Aid. Additionally, a 1% COLA increase was paid in SFY 2021-22 directly to providers and is also annualized in the in this years schedule. In addition, in an effort to fully maximize federal funding, OPWDD continues to encourage counties to participate in the Federal Salary Sharing program through the Office of Mental Health. Federal Salary Sharing enables States and Counties to receive federal reimbursement for the portion of local government expenditures related to the administration and oversight of Medicaid programs. Accordingly, OWPDD expects NYC DOHMH to continue any contractual relationships with such voluntary agency as long as such provider demonstrates compliance with New York City contractual obligations and OPWDD programmatic and fiscal standards.

Created by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1978, the Housing Choice Voucher program, also known as Section 8, provides assistance to eligible low- and moderate-income families to rent housing in the private market, and forms the majority of assistance. To aid automated processing of certain milestones in subsidy administration, HPDs Technology division has developed a Dotnet based public facing application and an Dotnet based administrative application. Both applications along with 15+ background daily/periodic batch processes, help DTR to take various Owner, PHA and participant requests and provide various decisions and documents in digital form.
