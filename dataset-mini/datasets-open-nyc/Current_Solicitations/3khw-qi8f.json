As North America\u001as largest public housing authority, NYCHA serves 339,900 authorized residents in 162,143 apartments within 277 housing developments through the conventional Section 9 public housing program. NYCHA also serves 29,789 authorized residents in 15,426 units within 58 developments that have been converted under the PACT/RAD programs. Through federal rent subsidies (Section 8 Leased Housing Program), NYCHA also assists approximately 201,938 authorized residents (92,595 families) in locating and renting units. The Comp Mod Department undertakes projects to rehabilitate and improve building performance at NYCHA campuses through an integrated and comprehensive approach requiring a design-build or progressive design-build delivery method. Through holistic capital improvements instead of individual projects, the Comp Mod Department seeks the long-term benefits of preserving public housing for current and future residents by enhancing the quality of their lives with improved living conditions. The purpose of the upcoming RFP is to solicit proposals from SI Services firms to establish rates and other terms and conditions in exchange for inclusion in a pool of SI Services firms to receive subsequent task order requests for SI Services.</p>","other_info_1":"Proposals received will be evaluated in accordance with the terms of the RFP. NYCHA anticipates that individual task orders will be issued for each Project, following a competitive mini-solicitation process to provide construction management services.

The construction management firm chosen in response to a mini-solicitation will be required to perform and complete all assigned scope of services.

Some of these partnerships were driven by economic trends and rapid technological advancement, while others were developed in response to natural disasters and public health crises. Regardless of the impetus, NYCEDC has always relied on its deep ties to private and non-profit partners to craft thoughtful solutions to pressing problems. As new challenges arise and the City of New York\u001as (the \u001aCity\u001a) priorities evolve, NYCEDC remains open to innovative and impactful project ideas and ways of working with outside partners to seize future opportunities.</p><p>In an effort to catalyze the development of projects that advance NYCEDC\u001as strategic priorities, NYCEDC is issuing this unique Request For Expressions of Interest (\u001aRFEI\u001a) to facilitate submission and review of partnership ideas that fall outside the scope of NYCEDC\u001as other active solicitations (i.e., traditional Request for Proposals or \u001aRFPs\u001a, RFEIs, leasing opportunities, etc.). Through this RFEI, private sector and non-profit organizations can propose NYCEDC partnerships for a wide variety of projects, which may include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Programmatic initiatives</li><li>Technology pilots</li><li>Capital projects</li><li>Impact investment opportunities</li><li>Improvements to NYCEDC operations</li></ul><p>NYCEDC encourages respondents (\u001aRespondents\u001a, each a \u001aRespondent\u001a) to propose creative, economically viable and financially sustainable projects that directly benefit the people and businesses of New York City. Although NYCEDC may be able to provide limited amounts of targeted seed capital to initiate a project with a demonstrated need, this RFEI is primarily focused on sourcing proposals that thoughtfully leverage NYCEDC\u001as in-kind, non-financial resources to drive impact. Examples of resources that Respondents could benefit from include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Access to NYCEDC asset(s)</li><li>Marketing and publicity support</li><li>Technical assistance and project management support</li><li>Community and network building assistance</li><li>Other types of strategic partnership support</li></ul><p>Proposals submitted through this RFEI will undergo a tiered evaluation process, allowing NYCEDC to provide feedback on the project concept before either party has committed to an in-depth due diligence process. Strong proposals may then be implemented in a variety of ways depending on the nature of the idea, availability of resources, and NYCEDC procurement policies. Respondents may be awarded a contract directly through this RFEI, a subsequent competitive procurement or an alternative partnership structure.</p><p>NYCEDC plans to evaluate the proposals on the basis of factors stated in the RFEI which include, but are not limited to: the proposal profile, the financial profile, and the impact profile.</p><p>It is the policy of NYCEDC to comply with all federal, state and City laws and regulations which prohibit unlawful discrimination because of race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, marital status and other protected category and to take affirmative action in working with contracting parties to ensure certified Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprises (\u001aM/WBE\u001a) share in the economic opportunities generated by NYCEDC\u001as projects and initiatives.</p><p>Companies who have been certified with the New York City Department of Small Business Services as M/WBEs are strongly encouraged to apply.

As a result of this Law, NYS Department of Health approves, licenses and monitors every SBHC in NYS. School Based Health Centers are medical health centers within the schools. They help students manage their illnesses during the school day. Because of the location, School Based Health Centers are an easy health care option for busy students with busy parents who cannot always make it to their doctor\u001as office.

(b) This RFQ represents the first step (\u001aStep-One RFQ\u001a) in which NYCHA is inviting statements of qualification (\u001aSOQ\u001a) from entities interested in participating in the second step, an upcoming request for proposals (\u001aRFP\u001a) (\u001aStep Two \u001a RFP\u001a). </p><p>Step Two - RFP (A) Only Shortlisted Proposers for a particular Project will proceed to the Step Two \u001a RFP stage and be invited by NYCHA to submit a Proposal. (B) Prior to issuing an RFP, NYCHA may, in its sole and absolute discretion, issue a draft of the RFP to the Shortlisted Proposers to solicit feedback only; the draft RFP will not be a solicitation for Proposals. Any draft RFP may include a draft form of Contract. (C) Awards Based on Best Value Evaluation (1) NYCHA anticipates that Step Two \u001a RFP will include two Scopes of Work, one for each Project. Proposals for each Project will be separately evaluated and scored in accordance with the provisions set forth in the RFP. (2) NYCHA will evaluate the Proposals received and select one Proposer to enter into the Contract for each Project. i. In the event the same Proposer is selected to enter into a Contract for both Contracts, NYCHA reserves the right to award one contract for both Projects if NYCHA determines, in accordance with the provisions that will be set forth in the RFP, that one Contract provides it with the best value. (3) Any resultant Contract awarded pursuant to this Procurement will be awarded to a responsive and responsible Proposer that offers the best value, as determined by the NYCHA in accordance with the criteria set forth in the RFP. (D) Stipend Payments: As part of the RFP process, NYCHA will offer a stipend to Shortlisted Proposers that submit timely Proposals that are responsive to the RFP but are not awarded a Contract. Payment of such stipend will be in exchange for, among other things, the transfer to NYCHA of certain intellectual property rights and related material arising from such Proposal.

Each bench is designed to test a specific sized meter ranging from Small (5/8\u001a -1\u001a) \u001a Medium (1 ½\u001a- 2\u001a) - Large (3\u001a \u001a 12\u001a). The meters are tested when we receive billing complaints from customers that have a discrepancy with their water bill. We also respond and provide test results when local elected officials make an inquiry on accuracy charges for their constituents. The bench assists in letting DEP know when meters should be removed from the system by using data of meters tested each day vs. the meter age and type in our system. We are able to determine failure rate of meters and can gauge meter removal needs based on our findings. This bench can only be obtained from MARS Company since they are the only manufacturer who produces computer driven high-speed water meter test equipment and turnkey installation packages in the United States. Any firm which believes it can also provide the required service IN THE FUTURE is invited to so, indicated by letter.</p>"}
