The lands in question lie within the Town of Carmel, Putnam County, and involve the proposed conveyance of a small piece of City-owned Pre-MOA land to the adjoining property owner, Sclafani Petroleum, Inc.  This property transfer will cure a longstanding encroachment of petroleum facility structures on City land. The proposed transfer is not anticipated to result in degradation to water quality in nearby West Branch Reservoir.    The Sclafani family acquired the petroleum facility property in 1982 from the Spain Oil Company.  The deed of conveyance incorrectly included the City lands within the legal description of the property.  The City lands correspond to two former \u001apaper\u001a roads identified as Depot Street and Lake Street that were never developed.  Over the course of many years the owners of the petroleum facility constructed improvements and structures onto the City property under the assumption that the City wall running along the western and northern bounds of the City property marked the edge of the property.      0.843 acres of City-owned Pre-MOA land will be conveyed to Sclafani Petroleum, Inc. for appraised fair market value and combined with their existing property (parcel 76.5-1-64.1).

,{"ceqr":"14DEP003Q","project_name":"Tallman Island Crib Stabilization","project_description":"The project would include the placement of stone to repair damage to the protective bulkhead at the Tallman Island Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).  The bulkhead consists of a 185 foot long, 9 foot wide concrete crib approximately 12 feet high.  The crib retains the perimeter plant access road.  The ends of the concrete crib headers have deteriorated resulting in the front stretchers falling out and loss of fill within the cribs. The proposed repair will excavate within the cribs and place rip-rap inside to prevent further erosion and failure or the bank.     \t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  The erosion of the backfill material has created a washout of material under and behind the concrete retaining wall landward of the bulkhead, and has undermined a portion of the overlying roadway to the point where it is not usable to traffic. The affected roadway is crucial to the delivery of chemicals such as hypochlorite to the Tallman Island WWTP facility. The proposed action is designed to expedite a repair that would restore safe use of the affected roadway and prevent exacerbation of the existing condition. Construction activities would take up to three weeks.       The scope of work includes the following major items:    \u001a\tClearing debris, including but not limited to timber and concrete objects, from work area  \u001a\tExcavation   \u001a\tLocal backfilling as required  \u001a\tPlacing filter fabric, bedding stones and rip-rap in the areas to be repaired","borough":"Queens","lead_agency":"Department of Environmental Protection","url":"https://a002-ceqraccess.nyc.gov/ceqr/ProjectInformation/ProjectDetail/9824-14DEP003Q"}

,{"ceqr":"12DEP037Q","project_name":"Jamaica Tributaries CSO Improvements","project_description":"The Jamaica Tributaries CSO Improvements Project would include installation of a new 48-inch interceptor\u001aa bypass sewer line parallel to the existing West Interceptor. The design of the proposed interceptor would relieve the existing \u001abottleneck\u001a that currently restricts wet weather flow to the Jamaica WWTP and, therefore, contributes to CSO events in Bergen Basin and Jamaica Bay. It is estimated that installation of the new bypass sewer pipeline to augment the existing twin 36-inch West Interceptor would reduce combined sewer overflows to Bergen Basin by 100 million gallons per year. In general, installation of the new 48-inch interceptor would require: (1) microtunneling of the new 48-inch interceptor pipe from the launching shaft to the two receiving shafts; (2) construction of launching and receiving shafts microtunneling boring machine; (3) replacement of a small segment of an existing 42-inch storm sewer under the Belt Parkway, and; (4) demolition of abandoned utilities and relocation of existing utilities that would interfere with the construction of the proposed interceptor.     The Bending Weir Installation would involve the installation of bending weirs at regulators JA-3, JA-14, and JA-6. Bending weirs are passive flow control devices designed to maintain water levels upstream of the overflow weir. There are a total of ten regulators located in the Jamaica WWTP drainage area (Figure 1). The three regulators included in the proposed Bending Weir Installation were selected due to their location in the Jamaica WWTP interceptor system. Bending weir installation within these three regulators would, unlike existing conditions, allow for full wet weather storage and subsequent reductions in CSO events. In general, installation of the bending weirs would entail (1) excavation to accommodate the bending weir equipment; (2) demolition and relocation of utilities that would interfere with the construction of the proposed regulators; (3) construction of chambers to house the bending weirs; (4) installation of the bending weirs; (5) Installation of access hatches over the bending weir units to allow for maintenance, equipment removal and visual inspection of the weirs from the street level; and (6) minor concrete repair work to return the work area to preconstruction conditions.","borough":"Queens","lead_agency":"Department of Environmental Protection","url":"https://a002-ceqraccess.nyc.gov/ceqr/ProjectInformation/ProjectDetail/8200-12DEP037Q"}

The pumping station is located east of the intersection of Lafayette Avenue and Zerega Avenue in the Bronx. The upgrade includes the replacement of all mechanical components (influent pipes, discharge pipes, force main, piping, valves) and the creation of a new electrical building and three elevated platforms. The elevated platforms will house a new 1,360 KW emergency back-up generator (which will replace an existing 2,000 KW generator which was never subject to any air analyses) and other electrical service equipment. This replacement ensures the functionality, safety and reliability in conveying combined sanitary and storm sewage to the Hunts Point Wastewater Treatment Plant.     In order to comply with NYC Local Laws 31 and 32 and the NYC Mayor\u001as Office of Resiliency Guidelines, the new emergency generator must have an entrance elevation above the FEMA 100 yr. flood zone, plus an additional 40 inches. To raise the generator and electrical service equipment, DEP is building three concrete platforms at +18.00 elevation (NAVD88), with approximately four feet extending over the East Wall. This extension over the East Wall will result in work within the adjacent area (150 feet) of a regulated tidal wetland, requiring a Tidal Wetlands Permit from the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). A tree growing two feet from the East Wall will need to be removed.
