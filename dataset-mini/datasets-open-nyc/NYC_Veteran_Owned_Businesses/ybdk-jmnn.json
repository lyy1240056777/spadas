Led by its founder, Colin O’Leary, the revered five-member team includes Beth Davis, Jonathan Ettricks, Candis Lai, and Brent Seberhagen. Lauded by clients and industry peers alike, each member brings a dynamic skill-set to the group, including the fact that multiple languages are spoken between them. The agents are extremely well-connected in and around the City, having spearheaded countless transactions in a myriad of neighborhoods across all five of New York’s boroughs. As Team Leader, Colin O’Leary -- a U.S. Air Force veteran and Long Island native -- has been the recipient of numerous distinctions within the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices NY Properties family, including the Leading Edge Society award, which is presented to the top 8% of agents in the BHHS network nationwide. He additionally received the BHHS New York Properties’ 4th Quarter Traditions Award in 2018 – bestowed upon the agent who most exemplifies the company’s core values. Beth Davis is renowned for providing her clients with white-glove service – working tirelessly to be an advocate as well as an educator when it comes to important marketplace trends. Having relocated with her family from Washington, D.C. to Switzerland to New York, she has a firm grasp of what it takes to successfully move from one market to the next (which is especially helpful among her international clientele). New York native Jonathan Ettricks has maintained a lifelong love of the City, having worked in public service for more than 20 years, including a role with the New York City Council. He is known for his hands-on approach when collaborating with his real estate clients, assisting them through each and every step of the transaction process. His deep-rooted knowledge of the City and its neighborhoods has made him a go-to for buyers and sellers alike. Licensed in New York and New Jersey, Candis Lai transitioned into residential real estate following a successful career in commercial sales. Born in Hong Kong, Lai has a background in software sales and consulting. She quickly developed a passion for real estate, which has helped fuel her inimitable success within the industry. Brent Seberhagen launched his sales career with the New York Mets, overseeing deals in the Financial District. Residential real estate is in his blood, having been influenced by his parents, who are successful BHHS agents in Chicago.
