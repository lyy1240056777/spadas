The Broadway League created Family First Nights as a way to introduce families from underserved communities to live theatre and encourage children to develop a life-long appreciation for the art form, an opportunity many participants may not otherwise have.  \n\nWorking with Council Member Weprin, the Broadway League will partner with a local social service agency to identify families and coordinate program logistics.  Families in the program commit to attend the theatre together three times over the course of a year and coordinate with the local social service agency to arrange transportation.  Families will take part in post-performance discussions with the cast and production staff of the shows, and are given packets with information on the theatre and the specific show.  Sponsors of the program are invited to join the families at their designated location before departing for photos and an opportunity to meet the participants.  Families have recently attended performances of MEMPHIS, IN THE HEIGHTS, THE COLOR PURPLE, BILLY ELLIOT, THE ADDAMS FAMILY, SHREK, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, HAIRSPRAY and many other Broadway productions.\n\nBy engaging families in repeated experiences through multiple productions, Family First Nights offers the opportunity to make live theatre part of their cultural heritage, as well as educate children on the many non-performing job opportunities available in our industry.\n\nThe Broadway League is the national trade association for the Broadway industry. The Leagueâ\u0080\u0099s 700-plus members including theatre owners and operators, producers, presenters, and general managers help bring Broadway to more than 30 million people in New York each year.","location_1_2":"729 Seventh Avenue 5th Floor\nNew York, NY 10019\n(40.760415532797595, -73.98373144999795)","borough":"MANHATTAN","latitude":"40.760103","longitude":"-73.983973","community_board":"5","community_council":"4","census_tract":"125","bin":"1022699","bbl":"1010017501","nta":"Midtown-Midtown South                                                      "}

Astella will collaborate with the NYC Department of Sanitation, the Coney Island Board of Trade, and Mermaid Ave. merchants to provide these services. Members of the Coney Island Board of Trade, in which Astella helped to revitalize and provides technical assistance, have noted that while most merchants keep the sidewalk area in front of their stores free of liter according to city law, additional liter and sidewalk dirt and stains accumulate throughout the remainder of the day. In addition, according to a survey of Mermaid Ave. merchants conducted by an Astella intern in 2010, cleanliness of Mermaid Ave. was cited as the number one concern among merchants on Mermaid Ave. A cleaner commercial corridor will inspire confidence and pride in the neighborhood, provide a welcoming environment for shoppers, a boost for Mermaid Ave. businesses, and sends the message that a clean neighborhood is important to the community and encourages residents and visitors to Mermaid Ave. not to liter and improve overall cleanliness. Astella will engage the services of a power-washing cleaning company to apply high pressure, hot-water power washers to remove tough dirt, stains, and gum on the sidewalk surfaces along Mermaid Ave. In addition, Astella will initiate a pilot program, hiring three Coney Island residents three times a week from May through November to sweep the sidewalks and street corners, and collect and bag refuse, including cans, bottles, food and food wrappers, newspapers, etc. One of those individuals will also serve as a crew supervisor. Once the pilot program proves successful, the program will continue, which will provide ongoing employment to a population that is disproportionately unemployed. These jobs will be a stepping stone to higher paying jobs.

Since our founding in 1997, FSH boasts a 100 high school graduation rate among FSH seniors and a 0 pregnancy rate for all. \n\nMore than 2/3 of our students come from low-income families or families living at/below the poverty level; 72 identify as black, 15 as Latina, and 13 as multiracial; 43 are 6â\u0080\u00939 years old, the rest 10â\u0080\u009318. Each year, about 70 of girls return to the program from the previous year, and our daily attendance rate is generally a very high 95.\n\nTo participate in the program, all girls must achieve or maintain a â\u0080\u009cBâ\u0080\u009d grade average or better in school. FSH provides tutoring and homework assistance to support the girls academically, and last season 94 met or exceeded this goal! In addition, girls participate in a series of 4 age-appropriate 6-week educational workshops on Financial Literacy, Communication  Public Speaking, Nutrition  Fitness, and Skating Theory  History that also strengthen their core academic skills. Girls also participate in cultural field trips; fitness and dance classes; college preparation workshops; mentoring, internship, and leadership opportunities; career week; and, new this season, a 16-week SAT test preparation program.\n\nFor the ice skating component, FSH provides each girl with skating instruction, equipment, and attire. Students measure their skills development with the Ice Skating Institute (ISI) Standards tests, and we emphasize that each of their successes on the ice models how they can set goals and pursue success in all other aspects of their lives. Last season, 96 passed at least one ISI test level, 13 passed two, and one student passed three.\n\nFunding would be applied to ice time and classroom rental expenses.","location_1_2":"361 West 125th Street\nNew York, NY 10027\n(40.811020383386335, -73.95309154845967)","borough":"MANHATTAN","latitude":"40.810952","longitude":"-73.953005","community_board":"9","community_council":"9","census_tract":"20901","bin":"1059308","bbl":"1019520009","nta":"Morningside Heights                                                        "}

We do this by partnering with public middle schools in low income, high-need communities and extend their learning day by 3 hours each day (a 35 increase over the regular school day). In that time, we work on academic support; 21st Century skills like teamwork, leadership, public speaking; and, most importantly, we help learning come to life for students through our apprenticeship model. Apprenticeships are taught by professionals in the private and public sector over a 10-week period on subjects that they are passionate about. For instance this past semester we had law students teach public speaking through a mock trial apprenticeship and a few teams of Google engineers teach math through video game design. At the end of the apprenticeship, the students present what they learned in a final product called a WOW! in front of an audience. Each WOW! incorpo!\n rates the content of the apprenticeship and ensure students are developing and using those 21st century skills. \nPart of what makes us unique and successful is that we have full-time staff in the school during the school day. They prepare for the 3-6pm program time by integrating into the school during the day. They observe teachers as they demonstrate both pedagogical and content knowledge, so that they can teach more effectively during the academic blocks of the Citizen Schools program. That way, when a teacher teaches fractions in a certain way, our staff knows that method as well and can streamline communication with the school staff and students. Additionally, our staff knows when tests are, both school and standardized, and can help students prepare in whichever way makes the most sense. This presence in the school also strengthens our school and community relationships.\nOur ultimate goal is to transform public education, so that all children are graduating from high school ready for college, work and civic life in the 21st Century.","location_1_2":"55 Exchange Place\nNew York, NY 10005\n(40.706255147759414, -74.01096476409757)","borough":"MANHATTAN","latitude":"40.706186","longitude":"-74.010907","community_board":"1","community_council":"1","census_tract":"7","bin":"1078988","bbl":"1000267501","nta":"Battery Park City-Lower Manhattan                                          "}

Two-thirds of our clients are low income or poor, with annual incomes of 20,000 or less. Because SAGE offers most of our programs and services for free, we incur significant overhead in delivering these services, including rent, utilities, and other-than-personnel expenses. Member item support is particularly useful in helping us meet these expenses, many of which are not covered by private sources such as foundation grants.\n \nSAGE is the nationâ\u0080\u0099s oldest and largest non-profit organization providing direct services and advocacy for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender older adults.  Since 1978, SAGE has pioneered social services, congregate services, and community building programs that tangibly improve the quality of life for LGBT older people in New York City. Likewise, our education and advocacy programs have raised visibility and awareness of LGBT aging concerns among mainstream providers, thus making key services more accessible for an underserved population that has endured a lifetime of discrimination. \n\nSAGE offers the most comprehensive slate of direct services for LGBT older adults in New York City, and our constituents in every district in the city.\n\nWe hope you will consider joining your fellow New York City Council members by generously supporting SAGE through member item funding in FY11-12.

We advocate for equitable resources for New York Cityâ\u0080\u0099s neighborhood parks, testify frequently at public hearings related to parks and open space, and meet regularly with the members of the City Council Parks Committee. In addition, NY4P opposes parkland alienation, the taking of public municipal parks for private uses. Supported by a volunteer legal team, NY4P pushes for legislation at the state level that will protect communities from the negative impact of alienation and for mitigation when alienation does occur.\n\nNY4P conducts research and issues reports and recommendations on critical issues related to parks development, management and sustainability. Our signature projects include the City Council District Profiles, which document parks and open space in all 51 City Council districts, and the Report Card on Parks project, an independent assessment of park and open space conditions. In addition, because the City has no master plan for the improvement and expansion of parks, NY4P created the Open Space Index, a set of 15 â\u0080\u009ctargetsâ\u0080\u009d for open space, based on extensive research and best practices. \n\nNY4P maintains constructive relationships with a coalition of nearly 300 neighborhood parks groups and conservancies. We organize an annual Parks Advocacy Day for this coalition to meet with elected officials, network with each other, and attend seminars on timely parks issues. In addition, many of our coalition members work with us on the Daffodil Project.","location_1_2":"55 Broad Street\nNew York, NY 10004\n(40.705305078842116, -74.01145754816122)","borough":"MANHATTAN","latitude":"40.705189","longitude":"-74.011505","community_board":"1","community_council":"1","census_tract":"9","bin":"1000821","bbl":"1000250001","nta":"Battery Park City-Lower Manhattan                                          "}

We respectfully request Councilman Recchia continue his partnership with us by contributing 10,000 toward the Philharmonicâ\u0080\u0099s education and community programs in FY12._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn November 2011, Junctions will launch in Brighton Beach with a full Brooklyn Phil performance at the Millennium Theatre, with a full orchestral performance of scores accompanying historical and contemporary Russian cartoons.\n_x000D_\nThe Philharmonic seeks the Councilmans support for education and community programs that will compliment Junctions, including Family Works and a relocated and re-focused Music Off the Shelves. In Brighton Beach, Family Works will focus on cartoon and music creation, while the Brighton Beach Music Off the Shelves concert will feature writers well-known to the Russian community.\n_x000D_\nIn addition to new Junctions programs, we seeks Councilman Recchiaâ\u0080\u0099s renewed support of the Philharmonicâ\u0080\u0099s music and arts education programs serving the 47th district. Currently, we are able to present concerts to more than 160 residents at the JCH Bensonhurst and Shorefront Senior Centers. We are also able to present School Time Concerts to several schools in the 47th. We invite the Councilman to suggest further 47th district partnerships with schools, community groups, and organizations who are in need.","location_1_2":"55 Washington Street Suite 656\nBrooklyn, NY 11201\n(40.702688366154774, -73.98957290186571)","borough":"BROOKLYN ","latitude":"40.70273","longitude":"-73.989602","community_board":"2","community_council":"33","census_tract":"21","bin":"3000088","bbl":"3000380001","nta":"DUMBO-Vinegar Hill-Downtown Brooklyn-Boerum Hill                           "}

It creates a dialogue between the community audience and the artists and helps to develop their writing.  It has 4 different components: One Woman Standing - female solo work; One Man Talking - male solo work; Notes from a Page - full length ensemble musicals; and Well Noted Shorts - short form musicals.This season over 200 artists participated and brought their work to over 2000 community based audience members.  The Eatfest gives a chance for emerging playwrights to develop and premiere one act plays from 10 minutes to 50 minutes in length.  For many of these artists, it is their first time having their play seen on a New York stage.  Each season 10 to 20 plays are developed and produced and also emerging directors and actors collaborate with the playwrights to birth the plays.  An Eatfest usually involves at least 100 district NYC artists that come together to premiere their work.  Most of these diverse artists do not have the means to develop and premiere their work.  The funds will be used to cover the costs of rehearsal space and artist stipends.","location_1_2":"15 West 28th Street, 3rd Floor\nNew York, NY 10001\n(40.74507881212179, -73.98809315850414)","borough":"MANHATTAN","latitude":"40.74515","longitude":"-73.988383","community_board":"5","community_council":"4","census_tract":"76","bin":"1015728","bbl":"1008300030","nta":"Midtown-Midtown South                                                      "}
