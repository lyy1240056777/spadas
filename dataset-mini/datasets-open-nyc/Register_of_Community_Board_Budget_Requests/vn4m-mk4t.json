ACS had previously suggested that an incredibly disproportionate share of cuts be applied to day care services in the Brooklyn CB6 district. 4 out of the 15 centers citywide slated for closure were specifically targeted to the district. Most of these slots are located in facilities directly adjacent to public housing (Red Hook and Gowanus Houses), whose residents rely on these services to enable them to work and/or attend school. Eliminating day care services removes one of the most important safety nets in the community. ACS had not attempted to renegotiate day care center leases, or otherwise lower their operating costs, before deciding to eliminate the service altogether.","response":"OMB supports the agency's position as follows: Please contact the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs at 212-341-0999.","responded_by":"OMB","responsible_agency":"Administration for Children's Services"}

At a minimum, additional funding is sought to help keep pace with cost of living increases which over time take more and more resources away from the base operating budgets from programming and salary monies. Effectively, by not providing for regular, modest increases the senior centers' budgets are being decreased over time as basic costs only go up. This need is especially pressing with an aging population, as more and more \"baby boomers\" will be placing increasing demands on these facilities, which is anticipated to increase in the near future.","response":"Further study by the agency of this request is needed.

Overflowing litter baskets create additional work for the department in discretionary cleaning, contributes to the clogging of catch basins, and results in the unfair issuance of summonses to victims of the strewn litter.
