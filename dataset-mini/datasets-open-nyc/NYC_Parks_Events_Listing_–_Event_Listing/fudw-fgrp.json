This is the second in a series of installations envisioning New York through the framework of Gracie Mansion as it has been inhabited over time.

The exhibit will be on view at the Poe Park Visitor Center on Tuedays through Saturdays from March 4 through March 29. There will be an opening reception with a Q&amp;A session on Saturday, March 11.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About <em>City Birds</em></strong><br />Raised in the Bronx, Elana Amity visited Poe Park numerous times. As a young child she roamed in and around the cottage, and as a teenager she and her friends danced while a band played in the gazebo. Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s poem &quot;The Raven&quot; was brought to life by her father who loved reciting poetry. Ironically, Poe completed his final revision of &quot;The Raven&quot; while living on 85 Amity Street, now West Third Street, in New York&rsquo;s Greenwich Village. Amity&rsquo;s current work includes numerous paintings and monotypes of birds found in New York City&rsquo;s parks, sidewalks, and window sills. Her birch bark paintings reflect images and textures found in natural settings. Her illustrated poems include the works of Wallace Steven, Edgar Allan Poe, William Wordsworth, and Wilfred Owen.</p><p><strong>Artist Bio</strong><br />New York City artist, Elana Amity, began her career as a teacher and freelance illustrator. She served on the board of the Society of Illustrators for many years. In 1984 she joined the faculty of LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts where she taught illustration, painting and drawing. In 2010 she opened a studio in Manhattan&rsquo;s Garment District. Her paintings, drawings and prints capture both fleeting and enduring moments oflife in cities, nature and beyond. Her work has been exhibited in galleries and public spaces at home and abroad.</p><p><strong>Related Events</strong></p><ul>\t<li>March 11: <a href=\"https://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2017/03/11/arts-culture-fun-city-birds-by-elana-amity1\">Opening Reception</a></li>\t<li>March 18: Artist Tour and Workshop</li>\t<li>March 25: Elana Amity Book Presentation: The Raven</li>\t<li>Angel Hernandez from The Bronx County Historical Society Lecture: Poe and The Raven</li></ul><p>Admission to the related events, including the opening reception,&nbsp;is free but space is limited.&nbsp;To RSVP, please email <a href=\"mailto:laura.alvarez@parks.nyc.gov\">laura.alvarez@parks.nyc.gov</a> or call (718) 367-3657.</p><p>Image: Elana Amity, Cardinal with Sparrows, 2015, Acrylic on Canvas - www.elanaamity.com</p>","snippet":"\"City Birds\" includes numerous paintings and monotypes of birds found in New York City’s parks, sidewalks, and window sills.","phone":"(718) 367-3657","email":"laura.alvarez@parks.nyc.gov","cost_free":"1","must_see":"0","url":"arts-culture-fun-city-birds-by-elana-amity1","notice":"0"}

The artists in <em>STRATA </em>collect and arrange found or invented artifacts from the urban environment, including river flotsam, ceramic shards, and architectural details, through various modes of discovery. They use their collections as source material for multilayered, abstract compositions that reframe our familiar surroundings and challenge the division between man-made and organic in favor of a more seamless view of the material world. <em>STRATA</em> is on view in the Arsenal Gallery now through April 24, 2014.</p><p>\tMarie Lorenz creates large scale, collograph prints from objects she collects on her excursions through New York City&rsquo;s waterways. In this new series of prints, Lorenz engages with the mysterious paths the objects have traveled by repeatedly printing the elements in ornate circular patterns, which evoke both tidal vortexes and folk art medallions.&nbsp;</p><p>\tKaty Fischer&rsquo;s ceramic sculpture is reminiscent of archeological discoveries. She is inspired by the way ancient artifacts become evocatively abstract shapes once they are broken, weathered and displaced, not unlike the bits of debris deposited around the city. The shard-like fragments read as both found and made, broken and whole, abstract and representational and suggest intriguing connections and possible histories.</p><p>\tOn his walks around the city, Max Warsh photographs architectural facades, which are used as source material for his work. For these new pieces, Warsh photographed buildings in the neighborhood that surrounds the Arsenal. He then reconfigures these found textures, grooved surfaces and cast ornamental details in his studio through cutting, painting and collage to arrive at compositions that reinvigorate our engagement with the visual language of the urban landscape.</p><p>\tIn the work of all three artists, the fragment points to a larger more complete whole and a sense that a sum of the parts does or could exist. However each artist works to evade the reveal: we never see the whole building, the actual found object, or the unbroken pot. Rather, these fragmented compositions convey the way memory is an amalgamated fiction rather than a knowable fact.</p><p>\tIn conjunction with STRATA , Audra Wolowiec will present the sound installation <em>Weather Language</em> on April 14, 2014, 6:00 &ndash; 8:00 p.m. at the Arsenal. The sound piece will be composed of <em>a </em>mixture of found sounds and vocal interventions that are sensitive to both the Arsenal site and the city at large. Wolowiecs&rsquo; voice will overlap with the voices of strangers she encountered while walking through the city, creating a sound environment that is as subtle and ambiguous as the weather.</p>The Arsenal Gallery is dedicated to examining themes of nature, urban space, wildlife, New York City parks and park history.&nbsp; It is located on the third floor of the Parks Department Headquarters, in Central Park, on Fifth Avenue at 64th Street.&nbsp; Gallery hours are Monday &ndash; Friday, 9 a.m. &ndash; 5 p.m.&nbsp; Admission is free.&nbsp; For more information on the Arsenal Gallery, please call 212-360-8163.","snippet":"The artists featured in STRATA, Marie Lorenz, Katy Fischer and Max Warsh, collect and arrange artifacts from the urban environment and create abstract compositions.","phone":"(212) 360-8163","email":"Artandantiquities@parks.nyc.gov","cost_free":"1","must_see":"0","url":"strata","notice":"0"}

The exhibit will be on view at the Poe Park Visitor Center on Tuedays through Saturdays from March 4 through March 29. There will be an opening reception with a Q&amp;A session on Saturday, March 11.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About <em>City Birds</em></strong><br />Raised in the Bronx, Elana Amity visited Poe Park numerous times. As a young child she roamed in and around the cottage, and as a teenager she and her friends danced while a band played in the gazebo. Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s poem &quot;The Raven&quot; was brought to life by her father who loved reciting poetry. Ironically, Poe completed his final revision of &quot;The Raven&quot; while living on 85 Amity Street, now West Third Street, in New York&rsquo;s Greenwich Village. Amity&rsquo;s current work includes numerous paintings and monotypes of birds found in New York City&rsquo;s parks, sidewalks, and window sills. Her birch bark paintings reflect images and textures found in natural settings. Her illustrated poems include the works of Wallace Steven, Edgar Allan Poe, William Wordsworth, and Wilfred Owen.</p><p><strong>Artist Bio</strong><br />New York City artist, Elana Amity, began her career as a teacher and freelance illustrator. She served on the board of the Society of Illustrators for many years. In 1984 she joined the faculty of LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts where she taught illustration, painting and drawing. In 2010 she opened a studio in Manhattan&rsquo;s Garment District. Her paintings, drawings and prints capture both fleeting and enduring moments oflife in cities, nature and beyond. Her work has been exhibited in galleries and public spaces at home and abroad.</p><p><strong>Related Events</strong></p><ul>\t<li>March 11: <a href=\"https://www.nycgovparks.org/events/2017/03/11/arts-culture-fun-city-birds-by-elana-amity1\">Opening Reception</a></li>\t<li>March 18: Artist Tour and Workshop</li>\t<li>March 25: Elana Amity Book Presentation: The Raven</li>\t<li>Angel Hernandez from The Bronx County Historical Society Lecture: Poe and The Raven</li></ul><p>Admission to the related events, including the opening reception,&nbsp;is free but space is limited.&nbsp;To RSVP, please email <a href=\"mailto:laura.alvarez@parks.nyc.gov\">laura.alvarez@parks.nyc.gov</a> or call (718) 367-3657.</p><p>Image: Elana Amity, Cardinal with Sparrows, 2015, Acrylic on Canvas - www.elanaamity.com</p>","snippet":"\"City Birds\" includes numerous paintings and monotypes of birds found in New York City’s parks, sidewalks, and window sills.","phone":"(718) 367-3657","email":"laura.alvarez@parks.nyc.gov","cost_free":"1","must_see":"0","url":"arts-culture-fun-city-birds-by-elana-amity","notice":"0"}

The top three submissions not only heighten the beauty of the surrounding park land but also provide a gateway into a greater discussion about the preservation of the environment. &nbsp;</p><p>\tImage Credits:&nbsp; <em>Scene-Sensor // Crossing Social and Ecological Flows, </em>James Murray &amp; Shota Vashakmadze</p>","snippet":"The Land Art Generator Initiative: Freshkills Park is an exhibition of the top 25 designs, selected from around the globe, for a public art piece that has the ability to harness energy.","phone":"(212) 360-8163","cost_free":"1","must_see":"0","url":"land-art-generator-initiative-freshkills-park","notice":"0"}

Songwriter and bandleader, Sandra Velasquez, found inspiration in American pop hits of the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s, and staying true to her bilingual mission, crafted Spanish and English lyrics for each song. &nbsp;Having bilingual lyrics is just the icing on the cake because the tunes are so finger - snapping good and cater to extremely wide audiences.</p><p>\tTen year old <strong><a href=\"http://www.kojoroney.com/\">Kojo Odu Roney </a></strong>loved the drums even as a baby. His father is jazz saxophonist Antoine Roney; his mother Nia Love, an established choreographer and dancer; and his uncle trumpeter Wallace Roney; Kojo sat down to his first drum set at the age of two and has never looked back. At such a young age Kojo understood how to play the drum set in jazz setting. By 4 years old, he was able to play with jazz ensembles confidently. Practicing daily helped Kojo match his understanding of rhythm and applying it to the drum set.&nbsp; By the age of 8 years old, he went on his first tour in Europe, which is the start of his professional music encounters. His travels included France, Italy, Switzerland and Greece. He also visited other countries including Serbia, Germany, Austria and Poland. Kojo shares the stage and performs with many professional musicians including Buster Williams, Darrell Green, Billy Spaceman Paterson, Rashaan Carter, Brandee Younger, Saadi Zain, Emanuel Ruffler and of course his father, mother and uncle. Some great highlights of Kojo&#39;s many experiences is having the chance to sit in with The Incredible Lenny White, The Great Al Foster and legendary Jazz drummer, Roy Haynes, while great jazz drummers Louis Hayes and Grady Tate were in the audience and also having the chance to becoming friends with The Great Jimmy Cobb.
