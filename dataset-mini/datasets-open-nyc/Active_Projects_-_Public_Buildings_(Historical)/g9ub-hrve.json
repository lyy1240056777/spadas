CS Fixed Building will be an Alt 1 to Tower D, so should have the same BIN.\r\n\r\nSite block/lot:  Block 702, parts of Lots 4 and 10\r\nSite address:  545 West 30th Street, NY NY  10001\r\nAnticipated construction completion date for the fixed building, phase 1, is Oct 16, 2019.\r\n \r\nThe Culture Shed is a brand new cultural facility (“the Culture Shed facility”) of approximately 199,000 square feet that will be located on West 30th Street in the Eastern Rail Yards at the Hudson Yards. The facility will be a multi-purpose venue. Culture Shed will produce and present a full calendar of events in its architecturally dynamic spaces that include galleries as well as flexible spaces to accommodate a range of performance disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe Culture Shed facility includes a non-moving, fixed building (the “Culture Shed Building”) and a moving, retractable shed (the “Shed”) that may be deployed over the Culture Shed Plaza (“the Plaza”) to the east of the Culture Shed Building to provide additional indoor or covered outdoor space for exhibitions and other programming.\r\n\r\nPhase 1, “The Project” (the Culture Shed Building) is the subject of this CCG application.  Phases 2 and 3 are not the subject of this CCG application, but are described below to provide a full description of the entire Culture Shed facility and the context for Phase 1.  \r\n\r\nThe overall Culture Shed facility will consist of the following phases:\r\n\r\n•\tPhase 1:  The Culture Shed Building:  This portion of the facility is referred to as the “fixed building”.  It is an 84,733 square foot, 107 foot tall, seven story structure containing museum-quality exhibition and performance galleries, a café, a roof gallery, circulation, and support spaces. It features expansive column-free floor plates that are suitable for the presentation of exhibitions and a wide range of performance productions and will include all the essential operating infrastructure to produce visual art exhibits, performances, and events.  The Culture Shed will only initiate Phase 1 in concert with the building of the Tower D core and shell where the mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and life safety systems that serve the fixed building reside.  These systems are included in the Phase 1 scope. Phase 1 is “The Project” that is the subject of this CCG application.  Anticipated construction completion date is Oct 16, 2019\r\n\r\n•\tPhase 2:  The Shed and the Plaza:  The Shed is a 125 foot tall movable structure comprised of 3 sides (north, east,south) and a roof. Its western side is open and is filled by the eastern face of the Culture Shed Building to which it is connected.  In the nested position, the Shed covers the Culture Shed Building (north, east, south, overhead).  In the deployed position, the Shed no longer covers the Culture Shed Building, but is still connected to it at the fixed building’s easternmost façade.   The Plaza is an 18,000 square foot open space directly east of the Culture Shed Building.  When deployed, the Shed covers the Plaza creating a large, tall, and flexible space for a multitude of programming.   When the Shed is not deployed (ie it is nested over the Culture Shed Building), the Plaza will be completely open-air and used for a variety of cultural activities that will be open to the public.  Phase 2 is part of the overall Culture Shed facility, but is not included in “The Project” that is the subject of this CCG application.\r\n\r\n•\tPhase 3:  Portions of Culture Shed in Tower D and the Podium:  Portions of the Culture Shed facility, primarily back office, service facilities, and mechanical rooms will be located in the residential building currently known as Tower D to be developed by the Eastern Rail Yard (ERY) Developer, Related Properties. Tower D is located on the east side of Eleventh Avenue between West 30th and West 31st Streets, immediately west of and adjacent to the Culture Shed Building.  The portions of the Culture Shed facility within Tower D are easily accessible from the Culture Shed Building as they are co-level, adjacent, and separated only by a structural construction joint.  \r\n\r\nPortions of the Culture Shed facility, primarily lobbies, restrooms, coffee bar, bookstore, back offices, catering kitchen, loading and service facilities, and mechanical rooms will also be located in the Podium.  The Podium is defined as the area below plaza level, below the Culture Shed Building and the Plaza,that is to be developed by Related Properties.  The portions of the Culture Shed facility within the Podium are easily accessible from the Culture Shed Building above via stairs and elevators.  \r\n\r\nCulture Shed Inc. is responsible for reimbursing Related Properties for the core and shell construction of the portions of Tower D and the Podium occupied by the Culture Shed facility (foundations, floor and roof structure, slabs,roofing, waterproofing, and curtainwall).  Culture Shed Inc. is responsible for construction and payment for the fit-out of these spaces (interior partitions, finishes, vertical transporation, glazing, etc.) by its own construction manager.  Phase 3 is part of the overall Culture Shed facility, but is not included in “The Project” that is the subject of this CCG application.","dollar_amount":"$30M to 100M","status":"Active"}
