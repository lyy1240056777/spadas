The most important development restrictions can be found in Section 661.6 of the Tidal Wetland Land use Regulations (Title 6, Part 661 of the Official Compilation of the Rules and Regulations of the State of New York). The most important use guidelines can be found in Section 661.5 of the Tidal Wetland Land Use Regulations.  Article 25 of the New York State Environmental Conservation Law (the Tidal Wetlands Act) provides that anyone conducting a regulated activity within a tidal wetland or tidal wetland adjacent area must first obtain a permit from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Conducting a regulated activity without a permit constitutes a violation. Any violation of the Tidal Wetlands Act can result in a significant penalty (at the time of this indenture up to $10,000 per day for each violation) as well as criminal sanctions. In addition, unpermitted structures and fill have to be removed at the owner\u0092s expense. Regulated activities include, for example: \u0095 Any form of draining, dredging, excavation and removal (directly or indirectly) of soil, mud, sand, shells, gravel or other aggregate from any tidal wetland \u0095 Any form of dumping, filling or depositing (directly or indirectly) of any soil, stones, sand, mud, gravel, rubbish or fill of any kind \u0095 The erection of any structures or roads, the driving of any pilings or the placing of any other obstructions, whether or not changing the ebb and flow of the tide and \u0095 Any other activity within or immediately adjacent to inventoried wetlands which may substantially impair or alter the natural condition of the tidal wetland area \u0095 Any subdivision of land. This list is not complete. It is therefore advisable to contact the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Region 2, Marine Resources Program prior to any activity within the tidal wetland or tidal wetland adjacent area to clarify whetheror not a permit is required.  (12) RESTRICTIVE COVENANT (when applicable): No alteration on any vacant tract of land, land with minor improvements or any tract of land containing bulldings which includes land contour work, topographic modifications, removal of top soil, vegetation, excavating, filling, dumping, changes In existing drainage systems, improvements in public rights-of-way, relocation of erratic boulders or modificatlon of any other natural features, whether or not a permit is required from the Department of Buildings, the Department of Transportatlon or other public agencies.
