{"Title": "Building Permits in [District of Columbia--Washington] {2021}", "Description": "The dataset contains locations and attributes of building construction and alteration permits applied for and approved by the District of Columbia Department of Buildings. These data are shared via an automated process where addresses are batch matched (geocoded) to the District's Master Address Repository. Users may find that some data points will contain 0,0 for X,Y coordinates resulting in inconsistent spatial locations. Addresses for these data points could not be automatically geocoded and will need to be manually geocoded to 'best fit' locations in DC.", "Creator": "Department of Buildings", "Provider": "Open Data DC", "Resource Class": "Datasets and Web services", "Resource Type": "Vector data", "Temporal Coverage": "2021", "Date Issued": "2021-01-04", "Place": "District of Columbia--Washington, District of Columbia", "Rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "Access Rights": "Public", "Format": "Shapefile", "Language": "English", "Date Added": "2023-03-08"}
